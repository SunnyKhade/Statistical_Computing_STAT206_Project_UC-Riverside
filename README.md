# Statistical_Computing_STAT206_Project_UC-Riverside

## Overview
This project analyzes historical and modern video game industry trends from the 1980s to 2025, exploring:
- Growth of the Action-Adventure genre
- Shifts from console to PC platforms
- Impact of rising development cost and time on game releases

The analysis is intended to provide insights for investors, gamers, and developers by examining multiple datasets and applying descriptive statistics and visualizations.

---

## Goals
- Identify major trends in video game genre and platform distribution.
- Understand the reasons behind market shifts post-2012.
- Explore correlations between platform changes, development costs, and release counts.
- Provide actionable recommendations for industry stakeholders.

## Key Findings
1. Action-Adventure games have grown significantly since the 1980s, with fluctuations post-2012.
2. PC gaming has steadily increased in market share, partly linked to the decline in console releases.
3. Rising development costs and longer production cycles are likely contributing to reduced release volumes.

---

## Limitations
- Analysis limited to publicly available datasets.
- Nominal nature of many variables restricts advanced statistical tests.
- Predictions for future trends have uncertainty due to incomplete data.
